**💸 Expense Tracker in Python**

A simple command-line based Expense Tracker built with Python and Pandas, where you can record, view, summarize, and visualize your daily expenses.

This project helps users stay organized by saving expense details in a .csv file and generating insights through summaries and bar charts.

**📌 Features**

✅ Add new expenses (date, amount, category, description)

✅ View all recorded expenses

✅ Clear all expenses

✅ View expense summary by category

✅ Plot bar chart of total spending by category

✅ Data is stored in a persistent .csv file
